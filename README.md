### What I learned

i initially began this project with the sole aim  to learn redux as i envisioned i was going to spread the code across components. Well, i did it and i believe i now have a firm grapse on using redux. Thats untill i went bonkers trying to validate the form!. i tried wrting native code without using any form validation libriaries and without consulting any resources.. i kinda did not meet up.. if you know what i mean. well i have been properly reminded that you cannot actually do everthing like superman does. 
i really enjoyed writing this code.

i'm currently refactoring the code and spreading it across components for easy readabillity

suggestions on improvements are welcome. Thanks!
